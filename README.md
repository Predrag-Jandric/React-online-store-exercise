<!-- ![Design preview]() -->

This is a practice project for learning and practicing various concepts and features of React but mainly routing and mapping data received from backend (Dummy JSON API in this case). 

The project allows the user to use multiple pages even thought React is meant as a single-page app. It also displays mapped custom data in a card component.

## The project includes the following pages:

* Home page: Displays basic information and serves as a starting point for the application.

* Products page: Shows all available products in a grid layout. Each product is displayed using the Card component.

* Contact page: just for practice.
